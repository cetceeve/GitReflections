Reflections for lesson 2

>>>What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?<<<
a directory called .git is created in the current directory. 
it will store the meta-data of all files inside the directory for git to use.
it is necessary to use git on the directory.
with git status i can overfiew what git is currently doing or expecting me to do.

>>>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?<<<
the staging area sits between the working directory and the git repository
it allows me to decide which files while be saved with the next commit
its basically a way to costumize the commit.
i can add and remove files from the staging area using git add and git reset.

>>>How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?<<<
by being able to use git diff and git diff --staged to compare between
working directory and the last commit, making it easier to see if a logical chage happend
i can also overfiew all the files a made changes to and maybe decide to split them up into two commits.
